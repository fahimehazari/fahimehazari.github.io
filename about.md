    I am currently a PhD researcher in KU Leuven at Biomechanics division under the supervision of Prof. Harry van Lenthe. My research focus is on computational biomechanics, medical imaging, and finite element analysis. I create educational content for <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/materialise-mimics/#instructor-1/">Udemy</a>, an online learning platform, specifically centered around mechanical and biomedical software packages that I have experience with.
